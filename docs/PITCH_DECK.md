# PulseAI — Pitch Deck (1-Page Summary)

---

## 🎯 The Problem
**APIs power 83% of web traffic, yet most teams are flying blind.**

Developers spend 15-20% of their time debugging API issues reactively. Current APM tools (Datadog, New Relic) cost $23+/host/month, take hours to set up, and aren't built for APIs.

## 💡 The Solution
**PulseAI: AI-powered API analytics that sets up in 2 minutes.**

One line of code. Instant dashboards. AI detects anomalies before they become incidents.

## 📊 Market
- **$15.5B** API Management Market (2025)
- **32% CAGR** through 2030
- **$4.2B** addressable API analytics segment

## 🏆 Traction (Projected Y1)
- 10,000 free users
- 500 paid customers
- **$594K ARR** by end of year 1

## 💰 Business Model
| Tier | Price | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| Free | $0/mo | Developers, side projects |
| Starter | $29/mo | Small teams |
| Pro | $99/mo | Growing teams |
| Enterprise | $499+/mo | Large organizations |

## 🛡️ Competitive Moat
1. **AI-first** anomaly detection (not bolted on)
2. **2-minute setup** vs hours for competitors
3. **Purpose-built for APIs** (not generic APM)
4. **Data network effects** — more users = better AI models

## 👥 Team Needs
- CTO with full-stack + AI expertise
- CEO with API industry + fundraising experience
- First hire: Senior full-stack engineer

## 💵 The Ask
**$500K pre-seed** to build MVP, launch free tier, hire first engineer.

**Use of funds:**
- 60% Engineering (hire + infrastructure)
- 20% Marketing (content, community, launch)
- 20% Operations (legal, admin, runway)

## 🚀 Vision
Start with API analytics. Expand to the full API lifecycle platform.
**Comparable exits: Datadog ($10B+), Mulesoft ($6.5B), Kong ($1.4B)**
